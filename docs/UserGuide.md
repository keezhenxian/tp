Worldly is a **desktop app for exchange students looking to manage their contacts**. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Worldly will get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## :rocket: Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed on your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users only:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

   **Tip:** You can check your installed Java version by typing `java -version` in your terminal. If it shows a version below 17, please install a newer JDK before running Worldly.

<br>

2. Download the latest `.jar` release from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

<br>

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Worldly.

<br>

4. Open a command terminal (e.g., Terminal for Mac users) and navigate to the folder you put the jar file in with the commands below:
- `cd` (Windows) or `pwd` (Mac/Linux) to check the current folder path.
- `cd foldername` to enter a subfolder within the current folder. For example,`cd first\second` (Windows) or `cd first/second` (Mac/Linux) would enter a folder named "first", followed by a folder named "second" (located within "first").
- `cd ..` navigates to the previous folder.

<br>

5. Once you are in the folder that contains the jar file, use the `java -jar worldly.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)<br>
   *Image: A GUI similar to the one above should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains a sample contact.*

<br>

6. Type your desired command in the command box and press the Enter key to execute it. For example, typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

- `list`: Lists all contacts.
- `add name:John Doe phone:98765432 email:johnd@example.com address:John street, block 123, #01-01 offset:+08:00`: Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
- `delete 3`: Deletes the third contact shown in the current list.
- `clear`: Deletes all contacts.
- `exit`: Closes the app.

<br>

Please refer to the [Commands](#commands) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## :star: Features

### Create new contacts
* Add up to 500 contacts with only 4 mandatory fields to start (name, phone number, email and address)
* Edit contacts for details you may have initially left out
* Tag each contact with up to 9 custom tags
* Worldly automatically validates your contact details (like email, offset, and country) and will reject entries that don’t match the allowed format — so your contact list always stays clean.

### Organise your contact list
* Archive and unarchive contacts to hide them from the main list while keeping their details stored
* Sort contacts by name, country or date added

### Save and edit your data

Worldly's data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data, with no need to save manually.
The data is saved as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file render its format invalid, Worldly may behave in unexpected ways, potentially discarding all data and starting with an empty data file at the next run. It is therefore recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
</div>



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## :speech_balloon: Commands

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Offset must be typed **immediately after the prefix**.
<br>
  e.g., `offset: +08:00` will not work, but `offset:+08:00` will.

* `UPPER_CASE` indicates the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g., In `add name:NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add name:John Doe`.

* Parameters in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g.,`name:NAME [tag:TAG]` can be used as `name:John Doe tag:friend` or as `name:John Doe`.

* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, including not at all.<br>
  e.g., `[tag:TAG]...` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tag:friend`, `tag:friend tag:family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g., If the command specifies `name:NAME phone:PHONE_NUMBER`, `phone:PHONE_NUMBER name:NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g., If the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

### Viewing the help menu: `help`

Shows the description and format of all actions a user can perform with Worldly, as well as the following in separate tabs:
* A table of valid country names for the `country:COUNTRY` field and their corresponding calling codes.
* A table of various regions and their timezones with respect to UTC for reference.
* A table of valid languages for the `language:LANGUAGE` field and the countries that use them.
* Shortcut: You can also open the help window by pressing `F1` or selecting *Help → User Guide* from the menu bar.


![help message](images/helpWindow.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a contact: `add`

Adds a contact to the address book.

Format: `add name:NAME phone:PHONE_NUMBER email:EMAIL address:ADDRESS offset:OFFSET [country:COUNTRY] [organisation:ORGANISATION] [event:EVENT] [channel:CHANNEL] [language: LANGUAGE] [note:NOTE] [tag:TAG]...`

*Do not include : in any field unless it follows the format*
* Case-sensitive uniqueness of contact names is enforced.
* A tag with the contact's country calling code is automatically added if the phone number starts with `+[COUNTRY CODE]`.
* The offset refers to the timezone offset with respect to UTC and must be specified in +/-HH:MM. You may refer to the help window (with `help`) for a reference table of offset values.
* The country field is **case-sensitive** and must match a country in the provided list (in `help`) **exactly**.
* The preferred communication channel field may be omitted, but if it is included, it **cannot be left blank**. You must specify one of the allowed channels: PHONE, EMAIL, SMS, WHATSAPP, or TELEGRAM. The channel is **case-insensitive**.
* The language field is **case-insensitive** and must match a language in the provided list (in `help`) **exactly**.
* With the exceptions of the channel and tag fields, optional fields can be included and left blank (e.g., `country:`), which would have the same effect as omitting them from the command entirely.
* A contact can have up to 10 tags (including 0). Each tag must be added with `tag:`.
* There are limits to how long each field can be. They are as follows:<br>
`name:`70 characters<br>
`email:` 254 characters<br>
`address:` 255 characters<br>
`organisation:` 60 characters<br>
`event:` 100 characters<br>
`note:` 500 characters <br>
`tag:` 30 characters per tag

*Image: Before and after of an edit. Upon successfully adding a contact, you should see a confirmation message.*


Examples:
* `add name:John Doe phone:98765432 email:johnd@example.com address:John street, block 123, #01-01 offset:+08:00 country:Singapore channel: email note:does not drink alcohol tag:friends`
* `add name:Betsy Crowe phone:1234567 email:betsycrowe@example.com address:Newgate Prison offset:+08:00 channel:Telegram language:chinese tag:criminal tag:friend`

### Listing all contacts: `list`

Shows a list of all contacts in the address book. The list is sorted in alphabetical order of the contacts' names by default, but if a sort command was previously run (e.g., `sortdate`), it will follow the last requested order.

Format: `list`

### Editing a contact: `edit`

Edits an existing contact in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [name:NAME] [phone:PHONE] [email:EMAIL] [address:ADDRESS] [offset: OFFSET] [country:COUNTRY] [organisation:ORGANISATION][event:EVENT] [channel: CHANNEL] [language:LANGUAGE] [note:NOTE] [tag:TAG]...`

* Edits the contact at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the number shown in the currently displayed list beside the contact's name. The index must be a **positive integer**, i.e. 1, 2, 3...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing country, leaving the prefix blank (i.e. country:) will remove the existing country.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the contact will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative. You can remove all the contact’s tags by typing `tag:` without specifying any tags after it.
* If the currently viewed list is not the main list (e.g., if a `find` command was previously run), the index will refer to that of the **current list**, not the main list.
* If you accidentally mistype a prefix (e.g., `emails:` instead of `email:`), the app will notify you with an error message and show the correct usage format.

<br>
<!-- To insert image -->

*Image: Upon successfully editing a contact, you should see a confirmation message.*


Examples:
*  `edit 1 phone:91234567 email:johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the first contact in the current list to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

## :question: FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Worldly home folder.

<br>

**Q**: Can I sync Worldly between multiple computers?<br>
**A**: Worldly does not currently support automatic syncing. You must manually copy the `data/addressbook.json` file between computers.

<br>

**Q:** If I archive a contact, will it still appear in search results or when sorting?<br>
**A:** Yes, the `find` functions search the entire list of contacts, both archived and unarchived.

<br>

**Q:** Can I undo a command if I delete or edit a contact by mistake?<br>
**A:** Worldly does not currently have an undo feature. Deletions or edits are immediate, thus it is recommended to make periodic backups of `data/addressbook.json`.

<br>

**Q:** Are command parameters case-sensitive?<br>
**A:** No, refer to the `add` command's details under [Commands](#commands) for more information.

<br>

**Q:** I am typing the correct prefix for offset but I am getting an error. What do I do?<br>
**A:** Check that you have not left a space between the end of the prefix and the parameter. You should use `offset:OFFSET`, not `offset: OFFSET`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## :jigsaw: Known Issues

* **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
* **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
